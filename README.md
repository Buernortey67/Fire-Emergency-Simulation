#Menark Fire Emergency Simulation: Experience a Safer Tomorrow

Overview

This project is a Virtual Reality (VR) fire emergency simulation designed to help users practice fire safety procedures in a safe and controlled environment. The simulation allows users to call 911, use a fire extinguisher, and identify potential home fire hazards. By using VR technology, this project aims to enhance fire emergency preparedness and decision-making skills while reducing panic in real-world situations.

Features

- Call 911 Simulation: Users experience an interactive 911 call during a fire emergency, simulating a real-life conversation with a dispatcher.
- Use of Fire Extinguisher: Users can grab and operate a fire extinguisher in the simulation, learning how to extinguish fire effectively.
- Home Safety Hazards: Users navigate a living room scene to identify potential fire hazards, such as heaters near flammable objects and overplugged power strips.

Technologies Used

- Unity: Game engine used to build the VR simulation.
- C#: Programming language for implementing interaction logic.
- Oculus SDK: Used for VR interaction with the Oculus headset and controllers.
- 3D Models: Various 3D assets, such as fire extinguishers, smoke, and fire models, were used to create a realistic environment.
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Used to build a website for hosting a live demo video of the simulation.

How It Works

1. Call 911: Users interact with an audio-based 911 call. A series of questions simulates a real emergency call.
2. Fire Extinguisher: A fire extinguisher is provided for the user to handle and extinguish a virtual fire.
3. Identify Fire Hazards: Users explore a scene to find common household fire hazards. Correct identification of hazards provides feedback with explanations on how to avoid them.

Live Demo

Future Work

- Adding more complex fire emergency scenarios, such as building evacuations or natural disasters.
- Improving VR interactions and controls for enhanced user experience.
- Expanding the range of fire hazards for more comprehensive training.
